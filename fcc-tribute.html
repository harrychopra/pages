There, Ritchie happened to go to a lecture about how Harvard's computer system, a 'Univac I', worked. He was fascinated by what he saw and began to explore computers more thoroughly, especially interested in how they were programmed.</p>

(At that time computer programming was not a degree, and computer labs were looking for anyone with potential to help on their computers.) Ritchie, with his unflagging curiosity, was perfect at the job. He worked at MIT for many years helping develop, alongside other scientists, more advanced computer systems and software.</p>

Most computers at the time took up entire rooms and had limited dial-in access, but smaller desktop computers were being developed, and these did not have easy to use operating systems. He decided that one was needed. MIT, Honeywell, and General Electric agreed, and other scientists joined him to help build the system - One that was able to handle up to a thousand users at once and could run 24 hours a day.</p>

Both then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed their own application programs and operating system from scratch. It was written in machine language and in 1970 when released, it was given the name "Unix", a pun on the name "Multics".</p>

                                    <p>To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson and Ritchie both created B. Later, B was replaced by C, which Ritchie himself wrote. In the early twenty-first century, "C" is still the dominant language of computer programming. It was such a simple, concise language that almost every single computer maker at the time switched to it.</p>

                                    <p>By now Ritchie and Thompson had re-written the Unix operating system, using "C" instead of the machine language, and had done massive testing on it. It was so simple to use that programmers all over were switching to smaller machines to do their programming, giving up the larger computers they thought they would never want to leave. Bell Labs became Lucent Technologies Inc., and began to sell Unix to developers, creating a whole new division for the company. Ritchie has credited his success to the fact that he did not have a computer background but had an open mind to possibilities that others never thought they existed.</p>

                                    <p>Ritchie is well respected as the father of Computing Techniques. He wrote applications and managed the growth of already released operating systems. Over the years he received numerous awards, including the ACM award for the outstanding paper of 1974 in systems and languages, the IEEE Emmanuel Piore Award in 1982, a Bell Laboratories Fellow in 1983, an Association for Computing Machinery Turing Award in 1983, an ACM Software Systems Award in 1983, and an IEEE Hamming Medal in 1990. He was also elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering in 1988. In April of 1999 he was the recipient of the United States National Medal of Technology. All of the awards Ritchie received were in conjunction with Thompson. After having headed Lucent Technologies' Systems Software Research Department, Richie retired in 2007.</p>

                                    <p>Dennis died in early October, 2011. During one of his interviews, Asked what he liked to do in his personal life, Ritchie admitted that his personal and professional lives are mixed together. He said: "I've done a reasonable amount of traveling, which I enjoyed, but not for too long at a time. I'm a home-body and get fatigued by it fairly soon, but enjoy thinking back on experiences when I've returned. A technology visionary without whom there might have had not been any C, C++ or Java and hence no Unix. Ritchie spent all his life in enabling technology truly become our extension and work better and more easily for us. This page is a loving tribute to a genuius who has changed our lives in ways it is hard to fully appreciate. As the famous computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi writes : "Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.."</p>
